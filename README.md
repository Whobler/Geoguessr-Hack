# Geoguessr-Script
This script is compatible with Tampermonkey

## To use this script:
## You need to request access to the Development Server from https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/

Press '1' in game to place a pin on a location that will randomly score you between 4500 to 5000 score. (pressing "guess" is required to guess)

Press '2' in game to place a pin on a location that will exactly score 5000 points. (pressing "guess" is required to guess)

Press '3' in game to see a brief description of the correct location.

Press '4' in game to open google maps set on the correct location in a new tab.

NOTE: I have removed the auto guess feature since it was a bit tempermental, from now on, the script will only place the marker for you on the map.

You should not abuse the "Max Score" feature in competitive modes, it will get you banned, I have had 2 accounts banned just with the little testing I have done while developing the script. However, to avoid bans, do not make your guess instantly at the start of the round, and use the "safe mode" feature by pressing '1'. This will make a guess that will randomly score you between 4500 to 5000 points. This should be less detectable.
